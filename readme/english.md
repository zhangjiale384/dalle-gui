Enter your API key here. Click [here](https://ai.voilatech.co.jp/) to obtain a more convenient API key from our official website, or you can also obtain one from the OpenAI website.
(Since some customers reported that OpenAI's API **only supports credit card payments** and **is restricted in some regions**, we have launched our proxy API, which supports **more payment methods** and can be used **smoothly in all regions** to meet the diverse needs of more customers.)

## Model
![My Image](./image/6.png "key")

Choose your model for image generation. Currently, we support both DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3:
- DALL·E 3 provides more **accurate depictions** based on your prompts but **is more expensive**.
- DALL·E 2's results are **slightly inferior** to DALL·E 3, but **it's cheaper**.

## Prompt
![My Image](./image/5.png "key")

Enter your prompt here. Try to **describe your desired image as accurately as possible** to ensure it meets your expectations. (Don’t worry if you’re unfamiliar with using prompts; we will **automatically refine** your prompt for the best possible results.)

## HD
![My Image](./image/7.png "key")

Enabling this option allows you to generate **higher-resolution images**, but it will also increase the cost.

### HD:

## Size
![My Image](./image/9.png "key")

Here, you can choose the image size. DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3 support **different sizes**, so select the most appropriate one for the model:
- **DALL·E 2**: 
  - 1024x1024
  - 512x512
  - 256x256
- **DALL·E 3**:
  - 1024x1024
  - 1024x1792
  - 1792x1024

## Style
![My Image](./image/15.png "key")

You can choose between two styles: vivid and natural. Vivid provides more **virtualized** images, while natural offers more **realistic** and **natural** images.

### vivid:

## Price
![My Image](./image/20.png "key")

Here, we will show you the cost of generating these images. The first price is for generating **the current image**, and the second is the total cost for generating **all images**.

## Image History
![My Image](./image/17.png "key")

This section records all the images you have generated, preventing the issue of losing ideal images due to not saving them in time.

## Prompts History
