## Reverse Proxy Link
If your geographic location or network environment restricts direct access to the API, please use our provided reverse proxy service to ensure smooth operations.

## Key
![My Image](./image/4.png "key")

Enter your API key here. Click [here](https://ai.voilatech.co.jp/) to obtain a convenient API key from our official website, or you can obtain it from the OpenAI official website.
> **Note**: Previously, some customers reported that OpenAI's API **only supports credit card payments** and is **not available in certain regions**. Therefore, we have launched our proxy API, which supports **more payment methods and can be smoothly used in various regions** to meet the diverse needs of more customers.

## Model
![My Image](./image/6.png "key")

Choose the model for generation. Currently, we support DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3:
- **DALL·E 3**: Provides **more accurate** depiction based on prompts, but **is more expensive**;
- **DALL·E 2**: Offers results that are **slightly inferior** to DALL·E 3, but **is cheaper**.

## Prompt
![My Image](./image/5.png "key")

Enter your prompt. Describe your ideal image as **accurately as possible** to ensure the generated image meets your expectations. (Users unfamiliar with prompt usage don't need to worry; we will **automatically correct** your prompts to achieve the best results.)

## HD
![My Image](./image/7.png "key")

This option helps you generate **higher clarity** images, but the cost will increase accordingly.

### HD:
![My Image](./image/13.png "key")
### NOT HD:
![My Image](./image/11.png "key")

## JB
![My Image](./image/8.png "key")

Checking this option will make the AI **less likely to alter your input**, ensuring that the AI strictly follows your prompts to depict the image. If you are confident in your prompt, or are using a revised prompt, you can check this option.

### JB:
![My Image](./image/14.png "key")
### NOT JB:
![My Image](./image/11.png "key")

## Size
![My Image](./image/9.png "key")

You can choose the size of the image here. The **supported sizes differ** between DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3, so please choose the most suitable one for your model:
- **DALL·E 2**:
  - 1024x1024
  - 512x512
  - 256x256
- **DALL·E 3**:
  - 1024x1024
  - 1024x1792
  - 1792x1024

## Style
![My Image](./image/15.png "key")

You can choose between two styles: vivid and natural. Vivid provides a more **virtualized** image, while natural offers a more **realistic and natural** image.

### Vivid:
![My Image](./image/16.png "key")
### Natural:
![My Image](./image/15.png "key")

## Number of Images
![My Image](./image/18.png "key")

Choose the number of images you want to generate. It is not recommended to generate too many at once to **avoid additional costs**.
> **Note**: When generating multiple images at once, only similar images based on a single prompt can be generated, not a sequence of images that tell a story as described by the prompt. For example, if the prompt describes a story, the generated images will be similar images rather than a series of images that narrate the story.

## Revised Prompt
![My Image](./image/19.png "key")

We will use AI to **correct your prompt** to generate the most suitable image. The newly generated prompt will be displayed in the Revised Prompt section.

## Price
![My Image](./image/20.png "key")

Here, we will display the cost of generating these images. The first figure shows the cost of generating **the current image**, and the second figure shows the total cost of generating **all images**.

## Image History
![My Image](./image/17.png "key")

All images you generate will be recorded here to prevent the loss of ideal images due to not saving them in time.

## Prompts History
![My Image](./image/17.png "key")

Here, all prompts used to generate images are recorded for future reference and reuse.
